# InterfactFIR

This repository contains a Qt application that displays the time domain and frequency of a signal (Sine, Square, etc) that is being convolutioned with a loaded FIR filter.

The idea is to simply show how FIR filters can change a given digital signal.

It uses Portaudio, Qt and OpenGL to make it posible to hear and see the signals.
